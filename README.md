## What problem are we trying to solve
This project was created to be a way for people to test their knowledge of coding via a quiz. When the user starts the quiz they are prompted with five multiple choice questions regarding to coding. After answering all of the questions the user is shown their score, which is the time remaining, and is allowed to submit their score with their initials to a highscore. After submitting their score they are brought to a highscore screen where they can see their highscore. From this page they can also go back to the quiz or clear out the highscores. The user can also view the highscores by clicking the link in the top left corner of the page.

## Requirements
- When the user clicks on the start button for the quiz then the timer starts and the user is presented with a question.
- When the user selects an answer to a question then the user is presented with another question.
- When the user selects an incorrect answer to a question then time is subtracted from the clock.
- When all of the questions are answered or the timer reaches 0 then the game is over.
- When the game is over then the user can save their initials and score.

## Notes
I believe that this project went very well. The functionality of my code fits the requirements of this task. I think that how I worked with local storage fits the criteria of this task, but there is likely better ways of accomplishing the task. I do believe that the functionality of my highscores page could be a lot cleaner and that is something that I plan to work on in the future.
